## **Decomposing social interactions**
Scripts and simulated data generated for the article *Decomposing social interactions a statistical method for estimating social impact and social responsiveness* (Wijnhorst et al. 2026). This repository contains simulated datasets, analysis scripts, and output files used to evaluate statistical models for decomposing social interactions into mean individual phenotype, social responsiveness and social impact. The study uses simulated dyadic interaction data and Bayesian mixed-effects models to assess the performance of alternative modelling approaches for partitioning phenotypic variation arising through social interactions at the individual-level. It also investigates consequences of study design choices on model performance and provides practical guidelines aimed at quantitative geneticists and behavioral ecologists.
